        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love learning how computers work, how they interact with the human world, and what makes them 
            tick. I am excited to learn more about this field and continue contributing to the world around me 
            through technology. I’ve always been passionate about learning new things, whether reading a book or 
            watching a movie, I just can’t get enough of it! My most extensive interests include programming, 
            mathematics, and economics, no matter what I’m doing at college or working on in my free time, you’ll 
            always find me surrounded by books and computers, and curious to learn about interesting 
            technologies.</p>

            <h3>Fingerprint voting system</h3>
            <p>These major projects for cse have the potential to touch a lot of lives. Since all the fingerprints in this world are unique, this project leverages that exact fact. The specifics on how you implement the project lie in your hand, but you can try out different things like automatically casting a vote when the machine recognizes the finger print, Only unlocking the voting interface when the machine reads your fingerprint correctly, etc.

                This project in democratic countries would help in doing the elections more fair and overall work in favor of democracy. It would be best if you gave this project a try because it will test out a number of tech stacks at a time.</p>

            <h3>A battery saver program for Android devices</h3>
            <p>Android devices are infamous for the amount of battery that they consume. Because Android is open-source, there are a lot of different devices out there. Optimizing apps for such a vast ecosystem is still a massive challenge for any app developer. Due to this poor optimization of apps, they tend to consume more battery.

                Another reason which could be said for the rapid decline of the battery percentage is the poor ram and other resources management, which you would find on the third party reskin of stock android. Your task in this project would be to create a battery saver app to help this omnipotent issue. This battery saver should be built natively for android.
                
                You can use a few different tricks like stooping the apps running in the background by force, ensuring that the user is notified of any app is draining large chunks of battery. Finally, you can also use ram management to your advantage by limiting the number of apps that are opened at any given time.</p>
